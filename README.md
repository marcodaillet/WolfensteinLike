# Wolfenstein3d
Cub3D is an exciting project where I get to create a 3D graphical representation of a maze from a first-person perspective using Ray-Casting principles. This is not just a programming exercise; it's was a chance to explore the world of graphics, colors, and shapes without getting lost in complex mathematical details.

## What to Expect

- A realistic maze environment using the miniLibX library.
- Different wall textures based on their facing direction.
- Distinct floor and ceiling colors.
- Smooth navigation through the maze using arrow keys and W, A, S, D keys.

## How to Run

1. **Compile the Project:**
   - Simply run the provided Makefile: `make`

2. **Execute the Program:**
   - Launch the program with a scene description file as the first argument. For example:
     ```bash
     ./cub3D map.cub
     ```

Now, immerse yourself in this interactive graphical adventure and explore the maze you've created with Cub3D!
